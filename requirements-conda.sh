# This file is only to be used as a necessary evil. Ideally all packages are
# placed (only) in the requirements.txt file, which installs with pip.
# Sometimes conda must be used, but the package managers do not always mix,
# so we wish to keep this to a minimum. Place any packages that must be 
# installed with conda in this file. It is recommend to specify both the 
# channel and version. Please also use -y to avoid user prompts.
